# UF_Projects_Repository
Repository for UF student projects by Alex Chase

For those grading the Data Structure Search Engine (COP3530 Project 3) - the primary files you'll need are main.cpp, BST.h, HashMap.h, and text.txt

I have tried uploaading through CLion itself but it refuses to accept my credentials, I apologize for any inconvenience this causes. I happened to be scrolling through stemED when I came across a question asking about SMFL folders and I quite honestly have no idea what it is or how to go about it. It's too late now but I thought I'd at least explain myself a bit.
